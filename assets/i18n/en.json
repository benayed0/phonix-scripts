      "adviceText": "Intensive screen usage can be correlated with an anxio-depressive score due to various factors. Social media and online gaming can create an environment of constant social comparison, generating feelings of dissatisfaction and inadequacy, which can worsen anxiety and depression. The impact on sleep is also a key factor as screen usage before bedtime disrupts the production of melatonin, promoting insomnia and sleep problems, which are often linked to anxio-depressive disorders. Additionally, the sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive screen use and relying on screens as an escape can also worsen anxious and depressive symptoms. The therapy you will undergo will help you find a healthy balance in your screen usage and take care of your mental and emotional well-being by diversifying your activities and promoting real social interactions."
